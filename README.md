# vassar-stat-final
This is the final project I completed for the "Applied Statistical Modeling" course at Vassar College.
I examined the relationship between STD experience and previously identified risk factors of STDs 
based on a representative sample of the U.S. population from NHANES 2007-2008 data.
I employed logistic regression modeling for my analysis and found that gender, race, and illegal drug experience are 
persistent predictors of STDs and that education level is another potentially significant predictor of STDs.
The course was taught by [Prof. Ming-Wen An](http://pages.vassar.edu/mian/) in Fall 2015.
